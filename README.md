# Minesweeper: Genetic Algorithm and Wisdom of Crowds Solution

## Description
This project aims to leverage the power of genetic algorithms combined with the wisdom of crowds approach to solve minesweeper, which is a NP-complete problem. The genetic algorithm simulates natural evolutionary processes to iteratively improve solutions, while the wisdom of crowds approach aggregates diverse perspectives to enhance decision-making and predictions.

## Features
- **Genetic Algorithm Core**: Implements a robust genetic algorithm for optimization.
- **Crowd Wisdom Integration**: Harnesses crowd-sourced data/input to guide the evolutionary process.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
```
et-xmlfile==1.1.0
openpyxl==3.1.2
```

### Installing
- Clone the repository: 
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/blakehourigan/Minesweeper_solver.git
  ```
- Install dependencies:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt

  ```

### Executing Program
- There are two options to run the program:
  ```
  1) Navigate to project folder, manually execute main.py using python.
  2) Execute main.exe on a windows machine. 
  ```
